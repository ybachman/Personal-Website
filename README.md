# Personal-Website

My personal website which will be used in my job hunt.

This website displays some of my ability to use HTML and CSS. Through this website, 
potential employers can view a PDF of my resume, unoffical spring 2016 college transcript, 
and my photoshop portfolio. They will also find links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

Upon hovering, the circle picture will rotate and fade to reveal a quick read-over of my basic 
information; then return to normal once the mouse isn't hovoring. Hovoring over the note 
at the bottom will magnify the image until the mouse is moved off the image.
